# Meditech

## Getting Started

Everybody wants to remain healthy and keep track of their health, yet nobody wants to do the cumbersome task of
managing the records. So, we have come to the rescue. We have the account of all the doctors, your complete
medical history and your daily vitals depicted as interactive graphs so that tracking your health is now a child's
play. This is a Health Assistance Website which will help doctors and patients to access patient’s medical history 
and effects. We have used creative charts, which can be looked upon and understood easily by doctors as well as patients.
